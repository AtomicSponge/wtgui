# Get Started

Install via NPM:

```
npm install @wtfsystems/wtgui
```

Requires the <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">Vue Router</a> to be installed and configured before use.  For more information please see its <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/guide/">documentation</a>.  Once the router is configured, navigation is handled by WTGui.

Also recommended is <a href="https://pinia.vuejs.org/">Pinia</a> for use as a global storage across menus.

See the <a href="https://github.com/wtfsystems/wtgui/tree/master/src">example application</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/wtfsystems/wtgui">source repository</a> for more details on setting up.
