# Get Started

Install via NPM:

```npm
npm install @wtfsystems/wtgui
```

Requires the <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">Vue Router</a> to be installed and configured before use.  For more information please see its <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/guide/">documentation</a>.  Once the router is configured, navigation is handled by WTGui.
